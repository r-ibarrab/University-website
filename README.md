# UniversityWebsite-HTMLPROJECT
Just a simple webpage of fake university to practice my HTML skills.
This project was completely done by following a tutorial of the Easy Tutorials youtube channel.

To run this project you just need to open the index.html with the live server extension. In this project there aren't any of the assets that are needed, if you want to see the full project you'll have to download them with this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DzEpUUBhUL5l-NeQ0IuaOpBZkmi9z1Fm/view
